# Movie Night

# Motivation:
For a long time I’ve always noticed how much time couples and friends spend together watching movies/television. Personally I always used to call my friends up to watch a movie or show at the same time. I wanted to create an application that made the whole ordeal much easier. 

This is a platform where users can talk and watch their favorite movies and tv shows together with their friends or new ones they make on the application!
